Question 3 (15 marks) 
The Cybersecurity Framework (discussed in the lecture notes) outlines a seven-step process for establishing or improving cybersecurity programs. Consider a small healthcare clinic that stores patient data electronically and relies on digital systems for daily operations. Write 100 words for each step on how you might use this Framework to manage cybersecurity in the clinic. Identify specific threats that are likely in this healthcare environment and how you would address them. Due to the brief word count, focus on one or two primary threats, such as data breaches or ransomware. List any assumptions about the clinic’s current cybersecurity status prior to this work.
